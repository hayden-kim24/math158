# Math 158 Learning Repository

Welcome to my Math 158 learning repository! In this repository, you can find all the functions and classes I've written in Python based on the materials I learned from "Math 158: Probability and Stochastic Differential Equations for Applications (CME 298)" for Spring Quarter, 2024 @ Stanford University. Please note that this is my independent project -- other than the code ising.py (which was submitted as the bonus component of pset 6), the rest is just me having fun with the material I learned.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of the code I developed while studying the Math 158 course. It includes various functions and classes that demonstrate the mathematical concepts covered in the course.

The course relied on the textbook "Applied Stochastic Analysis" by Weinan E, Tiejun Li, and Eric Vanden-Eijnde.

The broad outline of the course was the following:
- Basic Probability Concepts (Textbook: Ch.1)
- Limit Theorems (Textbook: Ch.2)
- Markov Chains (Textbook: Ch.3)
- Monte Carlo Methods (Textbook: Ch.4)
- Stochastic Processes (Textbook: Ch.5)
- Weiner Process (Textbook: Ch.6)
- Stochastic Differential equations (Textbook: Ch.7)

## Installation

To experiment with the code in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/math158-learning.git
```

Also, make sure that you have Python installed ....

To install all the required dependencies, run the command

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
